---

## 🎯 Pre-Demo Setup

1. Open browser to: `https://metris.sanjeevani.ai`
2. Clear any previous session data
3. Have sample documents ready (optional for Evidence Collection demo)

---

## 📍 Demo Flow

### 1. Opening Hook (30 seconds)

> *"Every organization using AI faces the same three questions:*
> - *How compliant are we?*
> - *What's our financial exposure?*
> - *Who gets hurt if we get it wrong?*
>
> *METRIS answers all three—with numbers you can actually use."*

---

### 2. Landing Page - The Three Pillars (1-2 minutes)

**Action:** Point to the three flip cards in the hero section.

> *"METRIS gives you three things no other platform does:"*

**Hover/tap each card to flip:**

| Card | Front | Back (Flip) | Talking Point |
|------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Score** | `___` | `743` | *"A single governance score. Not a checklist—a number. Benchmarked against 12+ frameworks including EU AI Act, NIST, and ISO 42001."* |
| **Dollars** | `$___` | `$2.3M` | *"Financial risk quantified. Monte Carlo simulation shows your actual exposure—not a guess."* |
| **Traceability** | `Who's affected` | `3,247 humans` | *"The human count. How many people are affected by governance gaps in this AI system? This is what regulators will ask."* |

**Key phrase:** *"Governance in numbers. Risk in dollars. Traceability to the Human."*

---

### 3. Start Assessment - Scout AI (3-4 minutes)

**Action:** Click **"Start"** button → Enter assessment flow

#### Step 1: Mode Selection
> *"You can go through a quick self-assessment or have a conversation with Scout, our AI governance assistant."*

**Select:** Conversation mode (recommended for demo)

#### Step 2: Scout Conversation
> *"Scout asks targeted questions about your AI system—what it does, where it's deployed, what data it uses. No 200-question surveys."*

**Demo talking points:**
- Natural conversation, not a form
- Adapts questions based on your answers
- Pulls from 12+ regulatory frameworks automatically

#### Step 3: Decision Volume (Critical!)
> *"This is where METRIS becomes unique. We ask: How many decisions does this AI make per day? Per month?"*
>
> *"This unlocks our Human Impact calculation—the actual number of people affected by your governance gaps."*

**Options shown:**
- Enter exact numbers
- Use industry benchmarks (auto-calculated)

#### Step 4: Evidence Collection
> *"Now we gather evidence. Connect your sources—we support multiple integrations."*

**Show the integration options:**
- Website URL scanning
- GitHub repository analysis
- Document upload (PDF, DOCX)
- Google Drive connection
- Notion workspace

> *"The more evidence, the more accurate your score. But even with just documents, you get actionable results."*

---

### 4. Dashboard Overview (2-3 minutes)

**Action:** Navigate to `/dashboard`

> *"This is your governance command center."*

#### Triple Metric Header
Point to the top metrics bar:
> *"Your three numbers—always visible. Score, Risk, Humans. This is what you report to the board."*

| Metric | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Score | 743/1000 | Overall governance health |
| Risk | $2.3M | Financial exposure (95th percentile) |
| Humans | 3,247 | Individuals affected by gaps |

2. **Framework Compliance**
   > *"One scan covers EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001, and more. No separate assessments needed."*

3. **Risk Speedometer**
   > *"Visual risk indicator—green to red. Executives understand this instantly."*

4. **Forecast Chart**
   > *"Monte Carlo simulation showing risk distribution. This isn't a single number—it's a probability curve."*

---

### 5. Human Impact Deep-Dive (1-2 minutes)

**Action:** Navigate to `/human-impact`

> *"This is our differentiator. Other platforms give you compliance scores. We show you who's affected."*

**Show:**
- **Decision Volume Card:** Daily/monthly AI decisions
- **Projection Chart:** 90-day impact trajectory
- **Traceback Modal:** Click to see the chain from governance gap → affected individuals

> *"When a regulator asks 'Who was harmed?', you have an answer. Documented. Auditable."*

---

### 6. Workflow Page (1 minute)

**Action:** Navigate to `/workflow`

> *"Here's how METRIS fits into your existing processes."*

Show the workflow diagram:
> *"Intake → Assessment → Scoring → Remediation → Verification. Continuous loop, not a one-time audit."*

---

### 7. ROI Calculator (1 minute)

**Action:** Navigate to `/roi-calculator`

> *"Want to know what governance actually saves you? Input your parameters—we calculate the ROI."*

**Key inputs to demo:**
- Number of AI systems
- Current audit costs
- Regulatory exposure

> *"Most organizations see 3-5x ROI in the first year—just from avoiding manual audit costs."*

---

### 8. Integrations (2 minutes)

**Action:** Navigate to `/integrations`

> *"We connect to your existing tools—no rip and replace. Notice the two directions: Data IN and Alerts OUT."*

**Walk through the 5 categories:**

| # | Category | Direction | Demo Focus |
|---|----------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | **Code** | Data IN | *"GitHub scans your repos, model cards, SECURITY.md—all automatically."* |
| 2 | **Documents** | Data IN | *"Connect Google Drive, Notion, or upload directly. Evidence collection made easy."* |
| 3 | **AI Platforms** | Data IN | *"Hugging Face is live. SageMaker, Azure ML, Vertex coming soon."* |
| 4 | **Direct Access** | Data IN | *"Scan any public URL. Or use our API for programmatic access."* |
| 5 | **Continuous Monitoring** | Alerts OUT | *"This is where it gets powerful..."* |

**Deep-dive on Continuous Monitoring:**

> *"The last category flows the other direction—alerts go OUT from METRIS to your systems."*

**Show the 3 subsections:**

1. **Alerts & Notifications**
   > *"Slack, Email, Webhooks. Get notified when your score drops, when drift is detected, when a checkpoint fails."*
   
   **Click Configure on Slack** — show the toggle options:
   - Score threshold alerts
   - Drift detection
   - Checkpoint failures
   - Weekly digest

2. **CI/CD Gates**
   > *"GitHub Actions integration. Block a PR if governance checks fail. Shift-left on compliance."*

3. **Ticketing & Workflows**
   > *"Jira integration auto-creates tickets for remediation. Every gap becomes an assignable task."*

**Key phrase:** *"Data flows in. Governance flows out. Continuous loop."*

## 🚨 Common Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| *"We already use [competitor]"* | *"Do they tell you how many humans are affected? Do they quantify your risk in dollars? METRIS adds the dimensions that matter for real accountability."* |
| *"Our AI isn't high-risk"* | *"Regulators are expanding what counts as high-risk. METRIS helps you stay ahead—and proves your position."* |
| *"We don't have time for another tool"* | *"METRIS replaces 4-5 manual audits. Most teams save 20+ hours per assessment."* |
| *"How accurate is this?"* | *"We use Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 iterations. It's not a guess—it's a probability distribution based on your actual evidence."* |
| *"$10K for an assessment?"* | *"Most organizations see 3-5x ROI just from avoiding manual audit costs. And one regulatory fine costs 10-100x that."* |
| *"Why pay for Professional?"* | *"Starter is a snapshot. Professional keeps you audit-ready continuously—real-time alerts, unlimited re-assessments, CI/CD integration."* |
